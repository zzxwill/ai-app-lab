## Quick Start
This guide explains how to quickly deploy the Chat2Cartoon_en project locally.

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/volcengine/ai-app-lab.git
   cd demohouse/chat2cartoon_en
   ```
2. Modify the backend/.env file and fill in the values for each configuration variable.
3. Install Python dependencies for the project.
   ```bash
   cd demohouse/chat2cartoon_en/backend

   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
4. Start the backend service.
   ```bash
   python index.py
   ```
5. Start the frontend service.
   ```bash
   cd demohouse/chat2cartoon/frontend
   npm install -g pnpm@8
   pnpm install
   cp ../.env ./
   pnpm dev
   ```
6. Configure CORS for your TOS bucket to allow the local browser to access media resources on the TOS bucket.
7. Visit http://localhost:8080 to experience the application.

## Technical Implementation
### State Machine Flow
The interaction between the frontend and backend is based on a series of HTTP requests to /api/v3/bots/chat/completions with SSE streaming responses. To manage the overall video generation process, the frontend stores the session history and the current process phase in the browser's local storage.

### Message Structure
The request sent from the frontend to the backend resembles a typical LLM chat request, where each request includes the entire conversation history, and the last message contains the current request's content.
In a normal scenario without regenerating media assets, the backend parses the current process state from the conversation history, determines the next state/step, and executes the corresponding generation logic.
The frontend needs to include the necessary information for the next generation step in the content of each new message. The information required for each step is as follows:
| Phase                 | Frontend Step | Required Information（message.content） | Component Dependency |
|:----------------------|------|:---------------|--------|
| Script                | Create Script | Story theme | Large Language Model |
| StoryBoard            | Create Storyboard | Story script | Large Language Model |
| RoleDescription       | Describe Roles | Story script and storyboard | Large Language Model |
| RoleImage             | Generate Role Image | Role descriptions | Text-to-Image Model |
| FirstFrameDescription | Describe First Frame | Story script, storyboard, and role descriptions | Large Language Model |
| FirstFrameImage       | Generate First Frame | First frame descriptions | Text-to-Image Model |
| VideoDescription      | Describe Video | Story script, storyboard, and role descriptions | Large Language Model |
| Video                 | Generate Video | First frame image and video descriptions | Video Generation Model |
| Tone                  | Set Tone and Dialogue | Storyboard | Large Language Model |
| Audio                 | Generate Audio | Tone and dialogue | Speech Technology |
| Film                  | Create Film | Audio, dialogue, and video | FFMPEG |

#### `user` Message
The content of a user request follows the format: {Mode} {Content}
- Prefix: Mode
	- CONFIRMATION: Confirms and proceeds to the next step.
	- REGENERATION: Requests modification of the current or a previous step.
- Content: A JSON text of the complete state, maintained by the frontend. It saves information from the current conversation, such as script info (storyboards), video info (videos), and audio info (audios). This is passed in the user message when needed for the next step. The JSON format can be referenced from the code in the app/models directory. If the mode is REGENERATION, the content needs a prefix like phase={State} to specify which phase's output to regenerate, e.g., "REGENERATION phase=RoleImage {"role_descriptions":"[N roles, role descriptions]"}"

#### `assistant` Message
The content of an assistant response follows the format: phase={State} {Content}
- Prefix: phase={State}, where State is one of the Phase enum values from the state machine above.
- Content: The content can be plain text, such as the full text returned by the language model during the Script or StoryBoard phases, or JSON text, such as the IDs of several ContentGenerationTasks returned in the Video phase, or links to several audio clips returned by the speech model in the Audio phase.
